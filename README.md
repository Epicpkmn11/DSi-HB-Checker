# HB Checker
This is a Python *(2 or 3)* script designed for checking for the existance of specific files. It was designed for checking a DSi's SD card for HiyaCFW and TWiLight Menu++, but by creating your own `HBCheckerItems.py` files you can use it for pretty much anything!

To use, simply place `HBChecker.py` in the root of whatever you're checking (such as a DSi's SD card) and run it using Python!
